Modularity is derived from splitting a blockchain into customizable layers of execution, consensus, settlement and data availability, which is what the Cosmos SDK enables. This means that developers can plug and play, making their blockchain customisable by using different software for different layers. For example you can choose to build a vanilla chain and use the Cosmos SDK with CometBFT. CometBFT will be your consensus layer and the chain itself would be the settlement and execution layer.
